  abstract =     {"Fortran remains one of the principal programming languages
                  used in high-performance scientific, numerical, and
                  engineering computing. The language as defined by its most
                  recent standards, with their introduction of object-oriented
                  programming and of coarrays, is often referred to generically
                  as 'Modern Fortran', and this term is increasingly used in the
                  literature. Thus, we see that Fortran's particular advantages
                  as a high-end numerical language, especially where arrays are
                  the main form of data object and/or where complex arithmetic
                  is involved, are still to the fore. It is able to attain the
                  highest achievable optimization, mainly because
                  multi-dimensional arrays are 'natural' objects and because its
                  pointers are highly constrained. There is every sign that
                  Modern Fortran will continue to be used to tackle major
                  scientific computing problems in the next decade and
                  beyond. This third edition of Modern Fortran Explained offers,
                  in 20 chapters, a comprehensive and uniform description of
                  Fortran 2018. The additional features now brought by the 2023
                  standard, which are mostly relatively minor in nature, are
                  described in two final chapters, the first on generic
                  programming and the second on other new or enhanced
                  features. This structure enables the reader to distinguish
                  clearly between what is old and what is new. This new edition,
                  written by experts in the field, three of whom have actively
                  contributed to Fortran 2023, is thus a complete and
                  authoritative description of Fortran in its latest form, with
                  the intention that it remain the main reference work in the
                  field"--},
